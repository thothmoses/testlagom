= AWS LoadBalancer Controller
:page-toclevels: 3

include::partial$include.adoc[]

To expose gRPC or HTTPS publicly to the internet you can use the https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/latest/[AWS Load Balancer Controller {tab-icon}, window="tab"] with a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[Kubernetes Ingress {tab-icon}, window="tab"] created by the Akka Operator. This is useful when external services or clients outside of the EKS cluster need to consume the gRPC or HTTPS endpoints.

== Install the LoadBalancer Controller

Follow the instructions in the https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/latest/deploy/installation/[Load Balancer Controller installation documentation {tab-icon}, window="tab"]

== TLS certificate

You need a TLS certificate for the internet facing load balancer.

Request or import a certificate in https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home[Amazon Certificate Manager console {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. Select the region you are working in.

For development and test you can import a self signed certificate, which can be created with for example:

[source,shell script]
----
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout dummy-key.pem -out dummy-cert.pem -subj "/CN=dummy/O=dummy"
----

== Enable grpcIngress

Add the `grpcIngres` section to the deployment descriptor:

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
  namespace: "shopping"
spec:
  image: <image>
  grpcIngress:
    enabled: true
    certificate: "arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:803424716218:certificate/fc15186b-1e4c-4c51-be9b-07a61601019f"
----

Replace the certificate `arn` with the one assigned by the Amazon Certificate Manager.

When the deployment descriptor has been applied the Akka Operator will create an Ingress and you can retrieve the public address with:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get ingress shopping-order-service-grpc-ingress
----

To access the public endpoint with grpcurl you use the public address from above, with port 443:

[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -insecure -d '{"cartId":"cart3", "itemId":"hoodie", "quantity":2}' k8s-shopping-shopping-18efcf54bb-2096059642.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com:443 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

You have to use the `-insecure` flag if the certificate is self signed.
