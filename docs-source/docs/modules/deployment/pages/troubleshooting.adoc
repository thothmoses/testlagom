When troubleshooting an Akka Microservices system, you will find the items described on this page useful.

== Deployment status

The `akkamicroservices` CR has a status with the purpose to give an overview of the deployment status of the application.

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get akkamicroservices
NAME                         PHASE     REPLICAS   DESIRED   AGE     UP
shopping-analytics-service   Running   1          1         7h14m   1
shopping-cart-service        Running   2          2         7h12m   2
shopping-order-service       Running   1          1         7h6m    1
----

You can specify a specific application by adding the name:
[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get akkamicroservices shopping-cart-service
NAME                    PHASE     REPLICAS   DESIRED   AGE     UP
shopping-cart-service   Running   2          2         7h14m   1
----

- `REPLICAS` displays how many replicas are currently running
- `DESIRED` displays the desired number of replicas of the application
- `UP` displays how many replicas have successfully joined the Akka cluster

If `REPLICAS` equals `UP` then all the Akka cluster is up and running without any issues on all the allocated pods.

More information is shown when using `-o wide`:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get akkamicroservices -o wide
NAME                         PHASE     REPLICAS   DESIRED   AGE   UP    NON-UP   UNREACHABLE  MESSAGE           IMAGE
shopping-analytics-service   Running   1          1         7h17m 1     0        0            Running 1 pods.   803424716218.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/shopping-analytics-service:20201218-061851-566473f
shopping-cart-service        Running   2          2         7h15m 2     0        0            Running 2 pods.   803424716218.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/shopping-cart-service:20201218-061851-566473f
shopping-order-service       Running   1          1         7h9m  1     0        0            Running 1 pods.   803424716218.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/shopping-order-service:20201218-061851-566473f
----

In this detail mode, it also shows `NON-UP` and `UNREACHABLE`

If `REPLICAS` is higher than `UP` then `NON-UP` will represent the non-zero number of replicas that are NOT in a normal operating state. In other words, the sum of `UP` and `NON-UP` equals to `REPLICAS`.

- `NON-UP` displays how many replicas are NOT in a normal operating state. It could be already leaving or just joining the cluster, or even down
- `UNREACHABLE` displays how many replicas are in an unreachable state from the oldest replica point of view

See https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster-membership.html#cluster-membership-service[`Akka Cluster Membership`] for more information.

Even more information with `kubectl describe`:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl describe akkamicroservices shopping-cart-service
----

The PHASE is `Running` when everything working. It is updated when there is some problem or deployment in progress. For example, before all Pods are ready it is `NotReady`.

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get akkamicroservices shopping-cart-service
NAME                    PHASE      REPLICAS   DESIRED   AGE   UP
shopping-cart-service   NotReady   2          2         7h20m 1
----

If the deployment failed, for example if referencing a missing secret:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get akkamicroservices shopping-cart-service -o wide
NAME                    PHASE              REPLICAS   DESIRED   AGE   UP    NON-UP   UNREACHABLE  MESSAGE
shopping-cart-service   DeploymentFailed   2          2         7h25m 2     0        0            akka.operator.action.ActionException: Action [GetAction] failed: jdbc Secret [shopping-cart-service-jdbc-zecret] doesn't exist
----

You can often get more information by inspecting the pods:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod name>
kubectl logs -f <pod name>
----

== Operator Events

The operator will create Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#event-v1-core[Events {tab-icon}, window="tab"]] when notable actions take place during its operation. Events may have a type of `Normal`, `Warning`, or `Error`.

They are similar to application logging, but are more coarse grained. A single event may be observed multiple times.

=== Event Reasons

|===
|Reason |Type |Definition

|`ReconciliationSuccessful`
|`Normal`
|The reconciliation of a Microservice has completed successfully.

|`ReconciliationFailure`
|`Error`
|The reconciliation of a Microservice has failed.
|===

=== Viewing Events

An operator event references the Pod of the operator and will appear alongside other Pod events in the `Events` summary table in a `kubectl describe pod` command.

Events from the operator can be identified as from the `akka-platform-operator` source.

== Logs

You can view the logs of the Akka Operator or the application Pods with:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get pods
kubectl get pods -n lightbend
----

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl logs -f <pod name from above>
----

The Logback configuration of the application can be reconfigured without building a new image as described in xref:operator-reference.adoc#logback[Configure logback]
