= Integrations with databases and message brokers

Stateful services need a datastore. You can store state using xref:concepts:event-sourcing.adoc[Event Sourcing] or CRUD. The example in the tutorial uses PostgreSQL for xref:microservices-tutorial:entity.adoc[storing the events] and xref:microservices-tutorial:entity.adoc[and creating a Projection for queries]. An alternative is described in xref:how-to:cassandra-alternative.adoc[]

To decouple communication between different Microservices, we can publish messages to a broker, such as Apache Kafka. The tutorial illustrates how to use Apache Kafka in xref:microservices-tutorial:projection-kafka.adoc[Projection publishing to Kafka]. See xref:concepts:internal-and-external-communication.adoc[Internal and External Communication concepts] for more information.
