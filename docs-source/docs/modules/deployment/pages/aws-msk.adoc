= Kafka - Amazon MSK
:page-toclevels: 3

include::partial$include.adoc[]

https://aws.amazon.com/msk/[Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka {tab-icon}, window="tab"] (Amazon MSK) is a fully managed Apache Kafka service.

== Create Amazon MSK cluster

Create a new Kafka cluster from https://console.aws.amazon.com/msk/home[Amazon MSK console {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. Select the region you are working in.

Select the following aside from defaults:

- Create cluster with custom settings
- VPC: Use the same as your EKS cluster is running in
- Select the private subnets from the EKS VPC for each zone
- Both TLS encrypted and plaintext traffic allowed

A typical cluster takes up to 15 minutes to create.

You find more detailed instructions and alternatives in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html[Amazon MSK documentation {tab-icon}, window="tab"]

== Allow EKS security group

To allow the nodes in the EKS cluster to connect to the MSK cluster you have to add a rule in the security group.

Go to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home[VPC console {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. Select "Security Groups".

There are 3 security groups for the EKS cluster and you should select the one with description "EKS created security group ...". The one that has a name that doesn't contain `ControlPlaneSecurityGroup` and doesn't contain `ClusterSharedNodeSecurityGroup` . Make a note of this security group id for the EKS cluster.

Go back to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/msk/home[Amazon MSK console {tab-icon}, window="tab"] and click on the "Security groups applied" in the MSK Cluster summary.

Edit inbound rules > add rule > All traffic > Source custom. Add the security group for the EKS cluster. Save rules.

[#create-topic]
== Create topic

To create a topic or other administrative tasks you can connect to the MSK cluster from a Pod in your EKS cluster.

You can create a temporary Pod for this with:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl run -i --tty msk-mgmt --image=adoptopenjdk:11-jre-hotspot --restart=Never --rm -- bash
----

Then install the Kafka command line tools with:

[source,shell script]
----
apt-get update
apt-get install wget -y
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.2.1/kafka_2.12-2.2.1.tgz
tar -xzf kafka_2.12-2.2.1.tgz
cd kafka_2.12-2.2.1
----

From https://console.aws.amazon.com/msk/home[Amazon MSK console {tab-icon}, window="tab"] you find the connection URL in the "View client information". Copy the list of ZooKeeper host/port pairs.

Save the connect string in an environment variable at the bash prompt of the Pod you started with `kubectl run`.

[source,shell script]
----
ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT_STRING="<copied ZooKeeper connect string>"
----

Create a Kafka `shopping-cart-events` topic with:

[source,shell script]
----
bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper ${ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT_STRING} --create --topic shopping-cart-events --replication-factor 3 --partitions 4
----

Exit the temporary Pod:

[source,shell script]
----
exit
----

== Kafka configuration

Place the connection credentials in a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secret {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. The Secret must contain:

* `bootstrapServersKey` - the URL to the Kafka bootstrap servers

From https://console.aws.amazon.com/msk/home[Amazon MSK console {tab-icon}, window="tab"] you find the connection URL in the "View client information". Copy the plaintext bootstrap servers.

The Secret can be created with for example:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl create secret generic shopping-cart-service-kafka-secret --from-literal=bootstrapServers=<copied bootstrap servers connect string>
----

To enable the Kafka integration you define the name of the secret in `kafka` of the deployment descriptor:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
  kafka:
    credentialsSecret: shopping-cart-service-kafka-secret
----

Apply the deployment descriptor:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
----

The Akka Operator will automatically xref:config-secret.adoc#main-conf[provide the configuration] for the connection based on the Secret when the application starts the `ActorSystem`.
