= Secrets and environment configuration
:page-toclevels: 3

include::partial$include.adoc[]

The Akka Operator has support for managing https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Kubernetes Secrets {tab-icon}, window="tab"] that can be used, for example, as credentials for custom integrations. Note that the operator has specific and more convenient support for xref:integrations.adoc[certain integrations].

== Secrets

Secrets with entries that will be mounted as files can be defined in `secretVolumes` of the deployment descriptor.

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
  secretVolumes:
    - secretName: shopping-cart-service-secret
      mountPath: "/etc/secret-volume"
----

The Secret can be created with for example:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl create secret generic shopping-cart-service-secret --from-file=connect.zip=secure-connect-bundle.zip
----

You can see the mounted files with:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl exec -i -t <pod name> -- /bin/bash

ls /etc/secret-volume
----

== Environment variables

Environment variables can be used for the configuration of custom integrations.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secrets {tab-icon}, window="tab"] with entries that will be included as environment variables be defined in `envSecret` of the deployment descriptor.

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
  envSecret:
    secretName: shopping-cart-service-env
----

The application.conf can use such environment variables with:

[source,conf]
----
      username = ${?DB_USER}
      password = ${?DB_PWD}
----

The Secret can be created with for example:

[source,conf]
----
kubectl create secret generic shopping-cart-service-env --from-literal=DB_USER=scott --from-literal=DB_PWD=tiger
----

== Configuration

For environment specific configuration that will override the application.conf in the image (jar) you can define configuration in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secrets {tab-icon}, window="tab"] specified by the `configSecret` in the deployment descriptor.

The entries in the Secret will be concatenated into a `main.conf` together with configuration provided by the operator. The `main.conf` includes `application.conf` and will be loaded when the `ActorSystem` is started.

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
  configSecret:
    secretName: shopping-cart-service-config
----

The Secret can be created with for example:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl create secret generic shopping-cart-service-config --from-file=logging.conf=kubernetes/logging.conf --from-file=environment.conf=kubernetes/environment.conf
----

You can see the mounted `main.conf` with:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl exec -i -t <pod name> -- /bin/bash

cat /etc/config-volume/main.conf
----

[#main-conf]
== Application configuration in the Pod

The Akka Operator will automatically provide configuration for the xref:integrations.adoc[Integrations] to the application.

For troubleshooting it can be good to know how the configuration is loaded.

The configuration that the Akka Operator provides via a Secret is located in `/etc/config-volume/main.conf` in the Pod. The `main.conf` includes `application.conf` and the JVM system property `config.file` is set to `main.conf` by the operator. In other words, `main.conf` will be used when the application starts the `ActorSystem` without specifying a configuration, or when using `ConfigFactory.load()`.

You can see the mounted `main.conf` with:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl exec -i -t <pod name> -- /bin/bash

cat /etc/config-volume/main.conf
----
