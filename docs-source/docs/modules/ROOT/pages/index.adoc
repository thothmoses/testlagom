:description: Guided documentation of Akka for specific use cases

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Welcome to the _Akka Platform Guide_!

Akka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications.

Both beginners getting started with _Reactive_ principles and active Akka users will find this guide useful to improve their understanding of how Akka fits into _Reactive_ and how Reactive concepts apply to Akka. The guide complements the {akka}[Akka reference documentation {tab-icon}, window="tab"], which presents all Akka features in detail.

The tutorials in this guide show end-to-end use-cases implemented in Akka with the Reactive principles in mind. The tutorials go through implementing a system step-by-step to illustrate how the Akka APIs apply together.

== How to get the most out of this guide

For a code-first experience, have a look at the xref:microservices-tutorial:index.adoc[Implementing Microservices with Akka tutorial] which walks you through an example project and explains how features from the Akka ecosystem fit together to build Reactive Systems. The tutorial will point you to the relevant xref:concepts:index.adoc[concepts] where applicable.

If this is your first experience with Reactive frameworks or with Akka, we present some background and ideas behind _Reactive_ in the xref:concepts:index.adoc[Concepts section]. You can read those when they are introduced in the tutorial, or read them first if you prefer a more theoretical overview before diving into the code. There you will learn for example:

* The challenges that Reactive Architecture can help you overcome
* A summary of Reactive Principles
* The benefits of using Akka

=== Some Key Quick links
You will find details on xref:deployment:aws-install.adoc[installing] 
and xref:deployment:aws-install.adoc#_update_akka_operator[updating] the Akka Operator on the Installation in Amazon EKS page.

== Akka Microservices tutorial

The xref:microservices-tutorial:index.adoc[Implementing Microservices with Akka tutorial] illustrates how to implement an Event Sourced CQRS application with Akka Persistence and Akka Projections.

The tutorial shows how to build and run each service step by step:

== Cloud deployment

Kubernetes has become the de facto platform for deploying in the cloud. The easiest way to deploy and manage Akka Microservices in Kubernetes is to use the Akka Cloud Platform, which is currently available for Amazon Web Services(AWS). The xref:deployment:index.adoc[Cloud deployment] section provides an overview of how the Kubernetes deployment with the Akka Cloud Platform works.

Each step of the tutorial has instructions of how to run in Kubernetes using the Akka Cloud Platform.

ifdef::review[REVIEWERS: I removed the link to the first step of the tutorial from here because it is a circular reference, that is, that page just links to another page in the deployment section.]

== How to...

Some development tasks arise from requirements on existing projects. The xref:how-to:index.adoc[] section collects guidance for how to introduce a new feature or architectural improvement on an existing codebase.
