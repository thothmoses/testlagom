== Reactive Manifesto

Introduced in 2013, the Reactive Manifesto summarizes the properties a system must fulfill to be considered reactive. The following are the four aspects all reactive systems must fulfill:

* *Responsive*: The system responds in a timely manner if at all possible.
* *Resilient*: The system stays responsive in the face of failure.
* *Elastic*: The system stays responsive under varying workload.
* *Message Driven*: Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary between components that ensures loose coupling, isolation and location transparency.

== Reactive Principles (and Patterns)

[quote]
As a companion to the <<Reactive Manifesto>>, the Reactive Principles incorporate the ideas, paradigms, methods, and patterns from both <<Reactive Programming>> and <<Reactive Systems>> into a set of practical principles that software architects and developers can apply in their transformative work.

The eight foundational principles of implementing a distributed system that make an application Reactive are:

[upperroman]
. Stay Responsive
. Accept Uncertainty
. Embrace Failure
. Assert Autonomy
. Tailor Consistency
. Decouple Time
. Decouple Space
. Handle Dynamics

== Reactive Systems

A collection of components decoupled in time and connected via message-passing.

A System is a building block of an application, and a Reactive System is one that adheres to the xref:#reactive_principles[Reactive Principles].

== Reactive Programming

[quote,'Jonas Bonér and Viktor Klang' ,'https://info.lightbend.com/reactive-programming-versus-reactive-systems.html[Reactive Programming vs Reactive Systems]']
____
Reactive Programming, [...] is a subset of Asynchronous Programming and a paradigm where the availability of new information drives the logic forward rather than having control flow driven by a thread-of-execution.

It supports decomposing the problem into multiple discrete steps where each can be executed in an asynchronous and nonblocking fashion, and then be composed to produce a workflow—possibly unbounded in its inputs or outputs.

== Reactive Streams

[quote,'','{reactive-streams}']
Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure. This encompasses efforts aimed at runtime environments (JVM and JavaScript) as well as network protocols.
