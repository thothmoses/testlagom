= Deployment and Container Orchestration


include::partial$include.adoc[]

To deploy an application built using Akka Cluster you can use the xref:deployment:index.adoc[Akka Operator].

The example from the xref:microservices-tutorial:index.adoc[Implementing Microservices with Akka tutorial] contains build files for creating a <<Docker>> container for your application.

Each step of the tutorial has instructions of how to run in Kubernetes, for example the xref:microservices-tutorial:grpc-service.adoc#kubernetes[first step]

Alternatively, you can deploy {akka-management}/kubernetes-deployment/index.html[Akka Cluster applications to Kubernetes without the Akka Operator {tab-icon}, window="tab"], but that requires more expertise of Kubernetes.
