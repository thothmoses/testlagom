= Message Driven vs Event Driven

Reactive Systems rely on {glossary-asynchronous}[asynchronous {tab-icon}, window="tab"] {glossary-message-driven}[message-passing {tab-icon}, window="tab"] to establish a boundary between components that ensures loose coupling, isolation and {glossary-location-transparency}[location transparency {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. This boundary also provides the means to delegate {glossary-failure}[failures {tab-icon}, window="tab"] as messages. Employing explicit message-passing enables load management, elasticity, and flow control by shaping and monitoring the message queues in the system and applying {glossary-back-pressure}[back-pressure {tab-icon}, window="tab"] when necessary. Location transparent messaging as a means of communication makes it possible for the management of failure to work with the same constructs and semantics across a cluster or within a single host. {glossary-non-blocking}[Non-blocking {tab-icon}, window="tab"] communication allows recipients to only consume {glossary-resource}[resources {tab-icon}, window="tab"] while active, leading to less system overhead.

[#message_vs_event]
== Message vs Event

A Message is some data sent to a specific address. In Message Driven systems, each component has a unique address other components can send messages to. Each of these components, or recipients, awaits messages and reacts to them.

An Event is some data emitted from a component for anyone listening to consume.

== Sending Messages vs Emitting Events

In traditional programming models, _Component A_ invoking a method in _Component B_ was coupled in time. If _Component B_ was busy or if it was slow when handling the method invocation, then _Component A_ had to wait.

In Message Driven systems, _Component A_ produces a message indicating it must be delivered to the address of _Component B_. _Component A_ then send the message and gets control back immediately instead of waiting for _Component B_ to complete the handling of the message. Components on a message driven system often have a queue where incoming messages can be stored in case of a load spike. Message passing is a building block for {reactive-principles}/principles/decouple-space.html[space decoupling {tab-icon}, window="tab"].

In Event Driven systems, components announce a location where they expose their events. So a _Component A_ emitting events will use a well-known location to publish them but not know which components are consuming the events. This well-known location is implemented using an ordered queue. Sometimes the queue is indexable so consumers can keep track of the events already consumed and the events pending.

== Events _are_ messages

As discussed above, in Message Driven systems, each component send items to a fixed recipient. In Event Driven systems, on the other hand, each component produces items of data with a fixed sender and shares them with any consumer. This comparison, though, can be misleading: the term 'Message Driven' refers to a building block on a system and 'Event Driven' refers to a higher level property of a system. So, using Message Driven tools we can build an Event Driven system.

There are multiple types of messages. A categorization of messages in a xref:cqrs.adoc[CQRS]/xref:event-sourcing.adoc[ES] application is the following:

- *Commands*: a message sent to produce a change on the state. The receiving component, if the command is valid, will update its state.
- *Events*: a message emitted by a component when its state changed. The event includes the necessary data to evolve the older state to the newer state. The event is a message sent to the publishing infrastucture where consumers may later retrieve it.
- *Queries*: a message sent to a component to obtain some information from it. A Query is a special type of message because it must include a sender address so the target component can reply.
- *Replies*: the response to a query. A component handling a Query message will produce a Reply message and send it to the sender address specified in the query message.
