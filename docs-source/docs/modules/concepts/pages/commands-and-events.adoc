= Commands and Events


include::partial$include.adoc[]

Commands and Events are two of the building blocks of xref:event-sourcing.adoc[]. In order to reconstruct the state of an entity in memory we must read the history of events for that entity from the datastore and process each event one at a time.

Once the state reconstruction finishes, the entity is ready to process new commands. A command is a request to mutate the state.

Events will be serialized and published into the _Journal_ table in the database. The _Journal_ can then be consumed by the emitting entity or by third parties (e.g. to build an aggregate or other kinds of projections). Events are built on top of xref:message-driven-event-driven.adoc#message_vs_event[messages].

A client trying to mutate the state of an entity will produce a command message and send it to the entity. Commands are a type of message. Sometimes, commands include the address of the sender, the entity can use the sender address to send a message back with a reply.

Events are {reactive-principles}/patterns/communicate-facts.html[facts {tab-icon}, window="tab"], while commands are requests for a state mutation.
