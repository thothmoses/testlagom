# Antora-based Akka Documentation

This folder contains the sources for parts of the [Akka Platform Guide web site](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-platform-guide).

This folder is structured as follows:
- The root directory contains the `Makefile` for the documentation generation process.
- The structured documentation is located under `docs-source/`.

Contributions to the documentation are welcome and encouraged.
If you are unfamiliar with the project or with asciidoc, please read the contribution guidelines below.

## Antora extension

The theme sources are in a Lightbend-private project at https://github.com/lightbend/antora-supplemental-ui-lightbend-theme

## Contributing to the Akka Documentation

Detailed information about working with the documentation is provided in the [docs-source](docs-source/README.adoc) folder.

## Building the Documentation

This part of the Akka documentation is built using [Antora](https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/), from asciidoc sources.
The building process is managed by `make` using the [makefile](./Makefile) script.


To build the documentation, use `make` with the following commands:

* `make local-preview`
    Generates the documentation and serves it at `localhost:8000`.

* `make html-author-mode` 

    Generates the documentation, in 'author' mode, to display review comments and TODOs. The result is available at `target/staging/index.html`.

* `make all` (default) 

    Generates the complete documentation bundle.

* `make html`

    Generates the html documentation and homepage. 

* `make check-links`

    Checks that the external links point to a reachable URL.

* `make list-todos`

    List all the TODOs, review comments, unresolve references, etc. from the documentation.

# Synchronize code for different parts of the tutorial

Each part of the tutorial has full source code in directories in `docs-source/docs/modules/microservices-tutorial/examples/`.

Many files are identical and maintained with `scripts/copy-identical-files.sh`, which copies the files.

The `00` directory is the "empty" project corresponds to the generated code from a future seed template. 

It's often easiest to make changes to the example in the full example (last part of the tutorial) and then
propagate those changes backwards with `scripts/copy-identical-files.sh` and manual edits of non-identical
files. IntelliJ has a good diff tool for propagating changes between files and folders.

PR validation in Travis will run the `scripts/copy-identical-files.sh` and fail the build if expected identical
files are different.
